# TODO: in order for this program to work properly, please make sure to close the Dynamixel Wizard
# TODO: remap all the motor IDs shown in the Dynamixel Wizard to 1-5 (or 1-4 depending on the number of motors)
# TODO: install the package pynput: pip install pynput

# TODO: to make sure the motors function properly, press S in the beginning to disable all torques. 
# NOTE: make sure to disable the motors when switching operation mode (by pressing S when the motors are already appended to the queue)
# NOTE: only use current control, extended position control and velocity control, everything else is useless

This program is used to command dynamixel motors from the keyboard without any hassle. The following keys are binded
and grouped into 4 types of actions:

Type 1: adding/removing motors to control using their IDs
    1-5: adding the corresponding motors to the list
    R: remove all motors from the list

Type 2: setting operating mode
    C: current control mode
    V: velocity control mode
    P: position control mode
    E: extended position control mode (with multi-turn)
    B: both current and position control mode (also with multi-turn according to the doc)
    M: PWM/Voltage control mode
IMPORTANT: For the control of the hand, only B will be used

Type 3: setting goals for the motors 
    UP: increase the current by CURRENT_INCREMENT
    DOWN: decrease the current by CURRENT_INCREMENT
    SPACEBAR: reset all currents to 0 mA
    RIGHT: increase the position by POSITION_INCREMENT
    LEFT: decrease the position by POSITION_INCREMENT

Type 4: everything else
    S: disable motor torques so that the motors won't impede movements when current or position commands are sent
    D: disconnect all the motors and terminate the entire program
